# Topic Modeling for CS5604 - Information Retrieval and Storage

This is the codebase for Topic Modeling (or Topic Analysis) for CS5604 - Information Retrieval and Storage course at Virginia Tech. The goal is to find topics or themes in tweets and documents in support of the GETAR project.

Currently, the project consists of just a collection of scripts. As the course progresses, this will be updated and perhaps transformed into a library that other people can use. This repository will also periodically be updated with the reports and presentations we make.

## SETUP

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
